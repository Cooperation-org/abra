# ABRa - A Brain Extension (and also magical)

Originally built ~2001 in Perl. Revived 2026.

Logo/mascot: a magic black cat.

Names are magic. To name something is to have power over it.

## History

The original Abra ran tucson.com as a production site — a city directory powered by the hierarchical catcode system. Imported phone book categories, Dewey Decimal, DMOZ, SIC codes, and user-defined hierarchies. 76,000+ categories, revenue-generating ($1,500-3,000/mo on AdSense). The catcode system is proven at production scale, not just personal use.
