ABRa - A Brain Extention

think:
  - name magic, names create power over what is named
  - pet names, ie a personalized, distorted mapping into info-space
    magnify and focus on specific points and relationships   
  - hot tags, words with definitions in memory can be referred to
  - the points in info-space may be entities: "ann" = my daughter; "ltq1" = the linked trust Q1 plan.  They may be skills or procedures.  Generally defined by blob of text but also may have formal attributes.  "ann" has a contact.  
  - may have known types of attributes, starting with IS, HAS and BELONGS_TO.  specific implementations of abra may have different eattribute sets. 
  - important: the data itself is durable.  implementations will change.  multiple implementations on the same data should be possible.  Like SQL.
  - reduces cognitive load for the user.  when i say 'whats next on ltq1' system already knows what that means and where to look up status.
  - enables powerful new instruments like a "hot tags" dashboard where every part of the screen relates to something i nmy head, in proportion to its current importance.  can rotate aspects.  So i can essentially load my team context and every part of the screen reflects things important to the team that are already in my brain or i need to know bc other team members put them there.
  - expiry and garbage collection important but also pinning.  Pinning works like emotional markers for permanance.
  - again, IMPORTANT - the data and relationships should be implementation agnostic.  we might quickly spin up completely different toolsets for the same data.
think message-in-a-bottle the data could be saved anywhere.
  - like semantic web or knowledge graphs but the relations and names are scoped to people and groups, so that all can use concise friendly local names

example: "did we get the peter contract" - system knows what peter contract means or can tell from hot tags, can look up status in system

keeping hot tags handy lets you jump in without mental overhead, AND lets the system meaningfull yparticipate in chats where people do this all the time, where most of the words assume shared context

it also helps preserve and empower user intention
