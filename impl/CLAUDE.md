# Abra implementations

Start by reading ../concept-notes.md — what abra IS and why it exists.

Each subdirectory is a separate implementation. They may be in different languages/stacks. They are throwaway — the data they create is not.

See ../binding-format-v0.1.md for the data format. See ../arch_notes.md for architecture.

learnings.md in this directory captures what we learn across implementations.
