# Raw Notes - Feb 14, 2026 - Relationship Types & Tag Permanence

## Three types of relationships

### Canonical (IS)
- amber IS my daughter. she is not a contact. she HAS a current contact
- intrinsic, definitional

### Has
- amber HAS a current contact (the contact may change, but the relationship type is possessive)

### Related
- something i want to show her, something for her birthday
- not really about her, just tagged with her name so i could bring it up later
- if related, should have a word or two optional about the relation
- like 'stack for' meaning things i might want to show later

## Naming larger concepts
- similarly could name the ltq1 marketing plan
- we could define it, then tag conversations relating to it
- the definition would be a long doc explaining our goals for q1, like getting into N podcasts and gaining credibility in area of decentralized trust etc etc
- then we might tag a bunch of podcasts
- those are not part of ltq1 in any permanent sense but they are tagged for it for now

## Tag permanence / expiry
- tags should also have some kind of expiry or the sense of being intrinsic or just 'for purpose of'

## Hot tags / active memory
- keep the last N active tags handy in loaded memory
- so if i say, how are we doing on ltq1 you can answer me
- it reduces my cognitive load
